## 1. Introduction
<br> 
We have used 13 geometric features to predict path loss in UAV based mmwave Air-to-Ground (A2G) channels. 
We developed six different supervised machine learning models and their performance is compared. 
The results of this research are submitted for publication in IEEE Access.
